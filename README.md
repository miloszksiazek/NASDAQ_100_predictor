# NASDAQ 100 Predictor üìà
This project is a data-driven solution for predicting the performance of the NASDAQ 100 index using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical market data and advanced models, the predictor provides insights to assist in investment decisions and market trend analysis.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Market Data Analysis: Utilize historical stock data for trend identification and prediction.
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Models: Employ supervised learning algorithms to forecast index movements.
	‚Ä¢	Visualization Tools: Generate insightful charts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction outcomes.
	‚Ä¢	Customizable: Adaptable for other stock indices or financial datasets.

Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python üêç
	‚Ä¢	Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
	‚Ä¢	Scikit-learn for machine learning
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution

How It Works
	1.	Data Loading: Import and preprocess historical NASDAQ 100 data.
	2.	Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data, such as moving averages and volatility indicators.
	3.	Model Training: Use machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks to predict future index movements.
	4.	Evaluation: Measure performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
	5.	Visualization: Plot predictions against actual data for validation and insight.
Usage
	1.	Clone the repository
 	2.	Open the NASDAQ_100_predictor.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
	3.	Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, train models, and make predictions.

Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Incorporate deep learning models such as LSTMs for time series analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Include sentiment analysis of financial news to improve predictions.
	‚Ä¢	Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time use.
